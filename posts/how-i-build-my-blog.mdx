# Why I started a blog

I've always been passionate about sharing knowledge and discussing the things I
learn. Since moving to South Korea, I've been working completely remotely, which
has given me fewer opportunities to share my knowledge with colleagues. Yes, we
have Slack and online meetings, but it's not the same as talking face-to-face.
So, I decided to start a blog to share my thoughts, ideas, and things I learned.

# The core stack

Let's start with the core technologies that powers my blog:

You might be wondering why I chose this *overkill* stack for a simple blog. Let
me explain:

1. I've been using Next.js for a while now, and I absolutely love it. It's easy
   to set up, delivers great performance, and offers a lot of features right
   out of the box.
2. Choosing CSS class names is hard. With TailwindCSS, I don't have to worry
   about that. When paired with Shadcn, an excellent collection of customizable,
   reusable components, I can create a beautiful design with minimal effort.
3. I didn't want to set up a database or create a CMS to manage my content.
   Instead, I use MDX files, which combine markdown with JSX. This allows me to
   write content in markdown and integrate React components when needed.
4. Lastly, this blog serves as a personal playground where I can experiment with
   new technologies and frameworks.

# Content management

I write my blog posts in MDX files. It's the most important part of my blog, and
I wanted to make sure it's easy to manage and maintain.

If you're unfamiliar with MDX, it's like an enhanced version of Markdown that
also supports JSX. Think of it as Markdown on steroids: you can embed custom
React components directly within your content.

With MDX, I can create interactive code snippets and embed them directly into my
blog posts, like this:

<CounterExample />

Another benefit of MDX is that it can be stored in a Git repository, making it
easy to host and manage my content. I use [Content
Collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/) to fetch and render my MDX
files. Content Collections are configured using a single TypeScript file named
`content-collections.config.ts`, which can define one or more collections.

The most interesting part for me is the `schema` property. You can define the
structure of the data using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and validate it against the
schema. For example, you can define a schema for a blog posts like this:

```ts
schema: (z) => ({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  categories: z
    .array(z.enum(["development", "design", "product", "business", "other"]))
    .default(["development"]),
  publishedAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime().optional(),
  published: z.boolean().default(true),
  image: z.string().optional(),
  imageAlt: z.string().optional(),
  video: z.string().optional(),
}),
```

You can use this schema and define metadata for your post directly at the top of
the MDX file, like this:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
description: This is my first blog post
categories: [development, design]
publishedAt: 2024-12-01T00:00:00Z
image: /images/blog/hello-world.jpg
imageAlt: Hello World image
---
```

# Styling

Back in the oldschool vanila JavaScript days, I used to write pure CSS. And
after that, I switched to SCSS. It was not bad, but the hardest part was coming
up with class names. With TailwindCSS, I don't have to worry about that anymore.
To compare, here's how you would style a button in CSS:

```css
.button {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #1d4ed8;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
```

```html
<button class="button">Click me</button
```

And here's how you would style the same button in TailwindCSS:

```html
<button class="inline-block rounded bg-blue-700 px-4 py-2 font-semibold text-white">
  Click me
</button>
```

It might look a bit weird at first, but once you get used to it, you'll never
want to go back.

I believe in the philosophy of not reinventing the wheel. Use the power of
open-source tools and building on top of it. Shadcn is a perfect example. It
offers a collection of customizable, reusable components built with TailwindCSS
and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives). Radix UI provides an
unstyled, accessible foundation for building design systems with React. It
includes essential features like full keyboard navigation, managed focus,
[WAI-ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
compliance for accessibility, and screen reader tested.

Shadcn components can be copy and pasted directly into your project. Which gives
you the full ownership and control over the code. You can customize the
components to fit your design system and make them your own.

Animations can make content much more engaging, and I use Framer Motion to add them to my blog. While I could have used CSS/Tailwind animations, Framer Motion simplifies creating complex animations with less code and more flexibility.

Here's an example of a simple animation using Framer Motion:

<FramerMotionExample/>

And here's the code for the animation:

```tsx showLineNumbers
<motion.div
  className="h-[150px] w-[150px] rounded-3xl bg-primary"
  animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
  transition={{
    type: "spring",
    duration: 5,
    bounce: 0.6,
    repeat: Infinity,
  }}
/>
```

# Code snippets

Writing technical content often involves sharing code snippets, which are great
for helping readers understand complex concepts. They become even more effective
with syntax highlighting and line numbers. To achieve this, I use
[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) for code highlighting. Here is an example of a
code snippet with syntax highlighting and line numbers:

```tsx {2} showLineNumbers
const dog = {
  name: "Mond (몬드)",
  breed: "Dachshund",
  age: 5,
};

console.log(`My dog's name is ${dog.name}`);
```

Standard code blocks are informative, but allowing readers to interact with them
takes things to the next level. Fortunately, there's a solution for that. I
integrated [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) (created by the team
behind CodeSandbox) to let readers edit code and see real-time results directly
within the blog. This makes the learning process more hands-on and engaging.
Sandpack even supports multiple files, popular frameworks like React and
Next.js, and custom NPM packages. Here's an example of a Sandpack code block:

<CodeBox 
  template="react"
  files={{
    "/App.js":
`export default function App() {
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
}`,
  }}
/>

# Performance
By using Next.js instead of a [Vite-based React app](https://vite.dev/guide/), I
benefit from built-in features like
[SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering),
[SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation),
and [image
optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images).

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation) pre-render content
on the server, serving it as static HTML files. This means content is available
immediately without waiting for JavaScript to load, and it significantly
improves SEO by making it easier for search engines to crawl the content.

Of course, not everything can be pre-rendered, such as interactive components or
dynamic data. In Next.js, you can define client components using the `use
client` [directive](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client). For example, a
client component can be defined like this:

```tsx {1} showLineNumbers
'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
 
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Final thoughts

After building this blog, I realized I should have started it sooner. It's an
excellent way to share knowledge, connect with others, and improve my skills. I
might not be the best writer, because of my dyslexia I make a lot of mistakes,
but in the end, it's all about sharing what I know and learning from others. I
hope this article inspires you to start your own blog and share your knowledge
with the world.

If you're thinking about starting a blog, my advice is to use technologies
you're comfortable with. Don't worry about the latest trends or what everyone
else is using. Focus on what you know and enjoy working with. It will make the
process more fun and rewarding.
